             In reality, observing such emergencies and to resolve them is a tough challenge. 
             Emergency services are government agencies whose job it is to respond quickly to 
             emergencies when  they arise, including fire-fighter, police, and ambulance service.
             We need these services which ensure urgent stabilization of the situation and transport 
             to definitive care. In this project, we have introduced a web site which provides an 
             overview of all emergency services and which can be accessible by everyone 24*7.
             The functionalities of the website are focused on providing a direct communication 
             service, complete and effective, allowing quick and accurate intervention of the 
             emergency services. Our purpose is to define a platform fully accessible to all users, 
             regardless of their languages and/or technological knowledge some of the features are 
             blood donation portal station to the fire department all in one place.</p>
